				</br>
				<p>When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his 
				world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand.
				 Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the dojo he attended, Ichigo 
				 started to smile again as soon as he saw Masaki when she came to pick him up.
				  </br></br>
				  At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect
				  one thing," which instilled in him a desire to protect his mother. When his
				  sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the sake of protecting them.
				  Since then, the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow,
				  causing Ichigo to risk his life to protect both the people close to him and
				  complete strangers.</p>

			<!-- About Asta -->
			
			<div class="asta">
				<h3>(アスタ)</br>Asta</h3>
				</br>
				<img class="img" src="Asta_Profile_Picture.jpg" alt="Asta"></img>
				<p class="caption">"My magic is never giving up!"</p>
			</div>
			<div class="asta-personality">
				<p>Anime: Black Clover</p>
				</br>
				<p>Asta generally is cheerful and hyperactive. He tends to shout to 
				express his thoughts and goals, much to the annoyance of some of those
				around him, and often in spite of other people's opinions. One of the 
				first examples of this is when he conveyed his goal of becoming a Magic
				Emperor during the Magic Knights entrance exam, and told other people 
				who jeered at him to be quiet. Asta's simple yet outgoing personality is
				frequently played to comedic effect during more serious situations. 
				However, his strong tenacity interests Yami Sukehiro enough to recruit 
				him into his ranks, and his determination also leads him to possess
				an indomitable will.
				  </br></br>
				  Asta's determination to never give up, added with his own steel 
				  fortitude during grueling or harsh battles, is a trait that becomes 
				  the basis for others to acknowledge him, such as Magna Swing. 
				  However, Asta has shown to have struggled accepting his lack of magic,
				  using his boisterous attitude as a front to hide his insecurity. 
				  After having his arms broken and cursed by Vetto, Asta nearly slips 
				  into a depression before talking and forcing himself to continue 
				  pushing onward.</p>

			<!--About Fuegoleon-->
			
			<div class="fuegoleon">
				<h3>(フエゴレオン・ヴァーミリオン) </br>Fuegoleon Vermillion</h3>
				</br>
				<img class="img" src="Fuegoleon_Profile_Picture.jpg" alt="Fuegoleon Vermillion"></img>
				<p class="caption">"Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of... Staying weak is!"</p>
			</div>
			<div class="fuegoleon-personality">
				<p>Anime: Black Clover</p>
				</br>
				<p>Fuegoleon is a fair person that judges people from their true worth rather than
				their social status. This side of him is seen when he is defending Asta from the 
				House Silva's oppression by reasoning with them that Asta was brought by Julius 
				Novachrono, which means that the Magic Emperor has acknowledged his worth. 
				Furthermore, his act also shows his view of justice where he would not stand and
				stay silent when someone is being oppressed regardless of the reason or the status
				of the perpetrator.
				  </br></br>
				  Fuegoleon has also been shown to have a charismatic personality that translates
				  to his leadership ability. He is able to quickly take charge of a situation and
				  deploy orders accordingly, such as giving several Knights orders after shortly
				  being informed that the Royal Capital is being invaded.[11] Fuegoleon is also 
				  very calm and collected in dire situations. He is capable of analyzing and finds
				  his opponent's weaknesses, even while defending against a barrage of attacks.

			<!-- About Crimson Riot -->
			<div class="crimson">
				<h3>(紅頬権斗) </br>Crimson Riot</h3>
				</br>
				<img class="img" src="Crimson_Riot_Profile_Picture.png" alt="Crimson Riot"></img>
				<p class="caption">"It doesn't matter what your quirk is if you've got a chivalrous heart!"</p>
			</div>
			<div class="crimson-personality">
				<p>Anime: My Hero Academia</p>
				</br>
				<p>Crimson Riot seems to be a hero with a very strong will who believes that 
				willpower is more important than one's Quirk, stating, "As long as you have a 
				manly spirit, it doesn't matter what kind of Quirk you have." He clearly states 
				that for him, the word "manly" refers purely to a state of mind, essentially 
				determination and courage, and therefore isn't gender specific, and can be found as
				much in men as in women.
				  </br></br>
				  Crimson Riot is haunted by an incident early in his career where his momentary 
				  hesitation led to civilian deaths. As a result of this traumatic experience, 
				  Crimson Riot became more fearful of watching innocent people die than of dying 
				  himself. Ironically, heroics fueled by this fear gave him a reputation as a 
				  fearless hero who always charged headfirst into danger without hesitation.
